# ODH Platform Utilities — Agent Guide

## What This Repository Is

`odh-platform-utilities` is a shared Go library for
[Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.io/) module controller development. It
provides common types, interfaces, and utilities extracted from the
[ODH Operator](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator) so that
module controllers can be developed independently while conforming to the
platform contract.

The library serves two primary roles:

1. **Platform contract** — defines the types and interfaces
   (`PlatformObject`, `Status`, `Condition`, etc.) that the orchestrator and
   modules must agree on.
2. **Shared utilities** — provides reusable helpers for manifest rendering
   (Helm, Kustomize, Go templates), singleton enforcement, admission
   webhooks, and Kubernetes resource manipulation.

## Architecture Context

The ODH platform follows a hub-and-spoke architecture:

- The **ODH Operator** (hub/orchestrator) manages a DAG of module controllers,
  reading their CR status via the `PlatformObject` interface to aggregate
  health, detect versions, and gate upgrade progression.
- **Module controllers** (spokes) each own a cluster-scoped singleton CRD and
  reconcile their component's resources.

This library is the shared dependency that both sides import.

## Coding Conventions

### Error Handling

- Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` to preserve the chain.
- Define sentinel errors (`var ErrFoo = errors.New(...)`) at package level for
  errors callers should match with `errors.Is`.
- Never discard errors silently; return them or log at an appropriate level.

### Naming

- Exported types use descriptive PascalCase names.
- Accessor interfaces follow the `With<Noun>` pattern (e.g. `WithStatus`).
- Condition type constants use `ConditionType<Name>` (e.g. `ConditionTypeReady`).
- Phase constants use `Phase<Name>` (e.g. `PhaseReady`).
- Sentinel errors use `Err<Description>` (e.g. `ErrNoInstance`).

### Kubebuilder Markers

Types in `api/common` carry kubebuilder markers (`+kubebuilder:validation:Enum`,
`+listType`, `+listMapKey`, `+kubebuilder:object:generate=true`). These markers
must be preserved — they drive CRD schema generation and server-side apply
merge strategy for module teams.

### Testing

- Use `t.Parallel()` in all test functions and subtests.
- Prefer table-driven tests for variations of the same assertion.
- Place tests in the `_test` package suffix to exercise the public API.
- Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` and `require` for assertions.

### Dependencies

Keep external dependencies minimal. Direct dependencies are limited to:
- `k8s.io/apimachinery` — Kubernetes API machinery types
- `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` — controller-runtime client interfaces
- `k8s.io/api` — core Kubernetes API types (for admission)

Do not introduce dependencies on `github.com/openshift/api` or on the
`opendatahub-operator` internal packages.

## Versioning Strategy

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- **Pre-v1** (`v0.x.x`): Breaking changes may occur in minor bumps and will be
  documented in release notes.
- **Post-v1** (`v1.0.0+`): Breaking changes require a major version bump.

See [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md) for the full policy.

## Breaking Change Policy

Changes to the following are considered breaking:
- Removing or renaming exported types, interfaces, constants, or functions
- Changing method signatures on exported interfaces
- Changing JSON struct tags on exported types
- Removing kubebuilder markers that affect CRD generation

When possible, deprecate with a migration window rather than removing outright.
